# BayMax-The-Virtual-Assistant

### This is my project for the course of Virtual Assistant

The project contains requirements.txt and multiple .py files that have the tasks that the assistant can perform. This project can be extended by anyone by adding their own method files.

The aim of this project is to build a virtual assistant that assists in day-to-day tasks and can be useful for quick and effective responses or completion of the tasks
The assistant can help in tasks like – 
Getting news – sports, politics, education, science, technology, biology, etc
Getting current weather
Telling a joke
Answering general knowledge questions
Getting Covid cases
Getting CPU usage details
Searching and opening YouTube video
